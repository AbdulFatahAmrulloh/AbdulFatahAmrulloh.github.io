This project involved developing a simulation system for ad-hoc vehicle networks (VANET) using the Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. The simulation was conducted using SUMO and OMNeT++ applications to model vehicle mobility and communication scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Simulation Environment Setup**: Configured the simulation environment using SUMO for vehicle mobility and OMNeT++ for network simulation.
- **Protocol Implementation**: Implemented the AODV routing protocol to manage routing in a dynamic network topology.
- **Parameter Analysis**: Analyzed key parameters such as end-to-end delay, throughput, and packet delivery ratio.
- **Results Visualization**: Created a website to interactively display simulation results and visualize parameters in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Simulation Tools**: SUMO, OMNeT++
- **Programming Languages**: C++, Python
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the AODV protocol in managing routing in VANETs. The simulation results provided valuable insights into the performance of the protocol under various network conditions.
