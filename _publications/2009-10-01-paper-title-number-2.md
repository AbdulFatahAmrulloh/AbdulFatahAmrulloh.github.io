Abstract / Description

Traffic congestion and the increasing number of road accidents caused by rapid vehicle growth in densely populated areas have become serious challenges. This issue highlights the need for intelligent technological solutions to improve traffic efficiency and safety. One such approach is the implementation of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication using Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) with the reactive Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol.

This study evaluates the performance of the AODV protocol through simulation using SUMO as a traffic mobility simulator and OMNeT++ as a network communication analysis tool. Performance evaluation parameters include Throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and End-to-End Delay (EED). The simulation was conducted on a real-world road map of Jl. Jenderal Sudirman, Purwokerto, and the results were visualized through a web-based dashboard.

The results indicate that increasing the number of vehicles improves throughput up to an optimal point; however, at higher vehicle densities, the PDR decreases from 4.85% to 4.19%. Vehicle speed significantly affects route stability, where higher speeds increase EED from 94.7 ms to 119.2 ms. These findings demonstrate that while AODV performs adequately under moderate conditions, it faces challenges in maintaining stable connectivity in high-mobility and dynamic urban traffic scenarios. Therefore, further optimization is required to enhance AODV adaptability for real-world urban VANET implementations.
