Abstract / Description

This study presents a design for 5G network coverage in the West Semarang area by implementing Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) and Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) techniques. The goal of this research is to evaluate how 5G technologies can be optimized to enhance signal coverage, throughput, and overall network performance in urban environments with high demand for wireless connectivity. By applying both SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO strategies, the network design is aimed at efficiently managing spectral resources and improving user experience in densely populated areas.

The methodology includes site planning, signal propagation analysis, and performance modeling using industry-standard wireless simulation tools. Results from this approach indicate improvements in signal strength and quality of service (QoS), demonstrating the potential benefits of deploying advanced MIMO strategies in 5G networks. The implementation of both SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO is shown to significantly enhance coverage reliability and data throughput compared to conventional single-antenna systems. This research contributes to practical insights into 5G planning and is expected to support future deployment strategies in similar urban settings.
