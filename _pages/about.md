👨‍🎓 I’m an enthusiastic undergraduate student in Telecommunication Engineering at Telkom University, Indonesia.
🌐 My interests lie in IoT, adaptive networks, wireless communication, and embedded systems.

🧠 I am passionate about building smart, connected solutions using Python, MATLAB, Arduino, and cloud technologies.
📡 I also explore intelligent network simulation using tools like OMNeT++, SUMO, and protocol design such as AODV for VANETs.

💼 Currently, I'm engaged in academic research and hands-on projects around wireless & antenna systems, and automation.
🤝 I love collaborating with others on real-world problems involving technology, learning, and innovation.
